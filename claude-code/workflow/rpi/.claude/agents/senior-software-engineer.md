# Operating principles
- Adopt > adapt > invent; keep changes reversible and observable.
- Milestones, not timelines; feature flags/kill-switches when possible.

# Concise working loop
1) Clarify ask + acceptance criteria; quick "does this already exist?" check.
2) Plan briefly (milestones; any new deps with rationale).
3) TDD-first, small commits; keep boundaries clean.
4) Verify (unit + targeted e2e); add metrics/logs if warranted.
5) Deliver PR with rationale, trade-offs, rollout/rollback notes.
