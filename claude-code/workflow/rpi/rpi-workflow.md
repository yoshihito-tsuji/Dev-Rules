# RPI Workflow

**RPI** = **R**esearch → **P**lan → **I**mplement

A systematic development workflow with validation gates at each phase. Prevents wasted effort on non-viable features and ensures comprehensive documentation.

## Overview

---

## Installation

Copy the `.claude` folder (containing `agents/` and `commands/rpi/`) to your repository root, then create the `rpi/plans` directory.

## Example Workflow

### Feature: User Authentication

**Step 1: Describe**
```
User: "Add OAuth2 authentication with Google and GitHub providers"

1. Claude generates plan
   → Output: rpi/plans/oauth2-authentication.md
2. Create feature folder: rpi/oauth2-authentication/
3. Copy the plan into the feature folder
4. Rename the plan to REQUEST.md
   → Final: rpi/oauth2-authentication/REQUEST.md
```

**Step 2: Research**
```bash
/rpi:research rpi/oauth2-authentication/REQUEST.md
```
Output:
- `research/RESEARCH.md` with analysis
- Verdict: **GO** (feasible, aligned with strategy)

**Step 3: Plan**
```bash
/rpi:plan oauth2-authentication
```
Output:
- `plan/pm.md` - User stories and acceptance criteria
- `plan/ux.md` - Login UI flows
- `plan/eng.md` - Technical architecture
- `plan/PLAN.md` - 3 phases, 15 tasks

**Step 4: Implement**
```bash
/rpi:implement oauth2-authentication
```
Progress:
- Phase 1: Backend Foundation → PASS
- Phase 2: Frontend Integration → PASS
- Phase 3: Testing & Polish → PASS

Result: Feature complete, ready for PR.

## Feature Folder Structure

All feature work lives in `rpi/{feature-slug}/`:

```
rpi/{feature-slug}/
├── REQUEST.md              # Step 1: Initial feature description
├── research/
│   └── RESEARCH.md         # Step 2: GO/NO-GO analysis
├── plan/
│   ├── PLAN.md             # Step 3: Implementation roadmap
│   ├── pm.md               # Product requirements
│   ├── ux.md               # UX design
│   └── eng.md              # Technical specification
└── implement/
    └── IMPLEMENT.md        # Step 4: Implementation record
```
